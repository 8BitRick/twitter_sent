============

Perform sentiment analysis on Twitter

This is just an assignment for a data science course on Coursera.
It could serve as a basis for actually measuring sentiment on Twitter when it is done.

We will be hacking in authenticity tokens for now because that is what the professor wants.
If you want to use this you will need to create your own twitter applicatin and provide your own auth tokens.
